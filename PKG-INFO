Description: Bookletimposer is an utility to achieve some basic imposition on PDF
        documents, especially designed to work on booklets.
        
        Bookletimposer is implemented as a commandline and GTK+ interface to pdfimposer,
        a reusable python module built on top of pyPdf.
        
        It allows:
        
        - to transform linear documents to booklets;
        - to reduce a document to put many on one sheet (for tracts for example);
        - to transform booklets to linear documents.
